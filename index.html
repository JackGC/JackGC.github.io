    <h1>Giancrlo Cortese's Website Per Week</h1> 
    
    <p>My name is Giancarlo Cortese. I am 13 years old by the time of making this website and learning 	HTML, CSS, and javascript. For the next few weeks I will be making a website every week. This is to test my abilities and for me to get comfortable with the process. This website will be a hub for all my projects. They will be bad in quality. I will try my best to make a website with a new consept every week.
